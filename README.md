**Overview
Product Context**
This repository contains a product strategy and MVP design slide deck for a 0→1 digital product addressing everyday emotional strain among young professionals who experience stress, anxiety, and emotional fatigue but do not engage with traditional mental-health solutions such as therapy or clinical wellness apps.
The product is intentionally positioned as non-clinical and stigma-free, focusing on early emotional support rather than diagnosis or treatment.

**Problem Space**

Despite increasing awareness around mental health, many young professionals:
Delay or avoid seeking help unless issues feel severe
Drop off from wellness apps that feel generic, intrusive, or time-intensive
Lack lightweight tools for daily emotional reflection and regulation
Experience notification fatigue and low long-term engagement
The core challenge is supporting emotional well-being in a way that fits naturally into real-world routines and limited emotional bandwidth.

**Research & Discovery**
The slide deck documents a structured discovery process, including:
Primary user research (surveys and 1:1 interviews)
Secondary research and competitive analysis
Synthesis of behavioral insights around trust, privacy, and habit formation
Research findings inform clear problem statements, user personas, and behavioral constraints that guide product decisions.

**Product Hypothesis**
**The central hypothesis explored is that:**
If users are offered short, natural-language emotional check-ins, combined with routine-aware nudges and strong privacy controls, emotional reflection becomes a repeatable, low-friction habit rather than an overwhelming task.

**MVP Strategy**

The MVP is deliberately scoped to validate core assumptions with minimal complexity:
AI-assisted micro check-ins
User-controlled nudge timing
Minimal onboarding and low cognitive load
More complex features such as peer support and coaching are intentionally deferred until core adoption is validated.

**User Experience & Journey**
The deck maps the end-to-end user journey from discovery to repeated use, emphasizing:
Ease of entry
User control
Progressive trust-building
Low-effort daily engagement
Each step is designed to minimize friction and emotional resistance.

**Metrics & Evaluation**
Success is measured through:
Activation and early engagement
Retention and habit formation
Churn and drop-off analysis
Metrics are chosen to reflect behavior change and trust, not vanity engagement.

**Business & Risk Considerations**
The deck outlines:
A freemium monetization model with optional premium layers
Distribution assumptions
Key risks such as churn, notification fatigue, and privacy concerns, along with mitigation strategies

**What This Project Demonstrates**
This project demonstrates the ability to:
Frame ambiguous human problems
Conduct and synthesize user research
Translate insights into MVP decisions
Design for behavior, not just features
Define success metrics and guardrails
Balance user value with business considerations
