Overview

This repository contains a product strategy and MVP design slide deck for a 0→1 digital product addressing everyday emotional strain among young professionals who avoid traditional mental-health solutions.

The deck demonstrates end-to-end product thinking, covering problem discovery, user research, hypothesis formation, MVP prioritization, user journeys, metrics, monetization, and risk analysis. The focus is on building a non-clinical, low-friction, privacy-first product that fits into real user routines rather than demanding behavior change.
